# MedConnect

MedConnect is a mock hospital software.  It was designed to emulate a hospital software which provides hospital doctors and administrators.
Provides management utilities for retrieving & updating info on admins, doctors, patients or medication data (dependent on access level).

Some notable features are complete database utility for data (no locally stored data), access level restrictions for administrators and doctors, and utilization of an "isTreating" relation which only shows doctors the patients they are treating rather than the whole database.

Developed in Java using eclipse, database in MySQL hosted at UW-Whitewater on the Washington server.
